# Getting Started

>**Note**: Make sure you have completed the [React Native - Environment Setup](https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup) instructions till "Creating a new application" step, before proceeding.

>**Note**: All progress is tracked and submitted through my [Jira Board](https://lachlanrg.atlassian.net/jira/software/projects/DEV/boards/1)

## To Run Application and All Components Together

```bash
# using npx
npx react-native@latest run-ios
```
After installing dependencies, ensure you link pods for IOS

```bash
# using npx
cd ios
npx pod-install
```

## To Run Components Individually:

## Step 1: Start the Metro Server

First, you will need to start **Metro**, the JavaScript _bundler_ that ships _with_ React Native.

To start Metro, run the following command from the _root_ of your React Native project:

```bash
# using npx
npm start

# OR using Yarn
yarn start
```

## Step 2: Start your Application

Let Metro Bundler run in its _own_ terminal. Open a _new_ terminal from the _root_ of your React Native project. Run the following command to start your _Android_ or _iOS_ app:

### For Android

```bash
# using npm
npm run android

# OR using Yarn
yarn android
```

### For iOS

```bash
# using npm
npm run ios

# OR using Yarn
yarn ios
```

If everything is set up _correctly_, you should see your new app running in your _Android Emulator_ or _iOS Simulator_ shortly provided you have set up your emulator/simulator correctly.

This is one way to run your app â€” you can also run it directly from within Android Studio and Xcode respectively.


# Troubleshooting

If you get error, or similar to:

```bash
# Error fetching posts: {"data": {}, "errors": [[GraphQLError: Unauthorized]]}
```

Navigate to AWS AppSync Console, create a new API Key, and copy the key into:
```bash
aws-exports.js
#"aws_appsync_apiKey":
```
